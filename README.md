# cat_facts

My new Flutter project.

The application receives a random picture and a fact about cats from the Internet.
The application has 2 buttons: ‘Another fact!’ and ‘Fact history’.
Clicking ‘Another fact!’ updates the picture and the fact.
Pressing ‘Fact history’ opens a screen with previously saved facts and the dates they were created.

The application is developed for two APIs for receiving images: for https://cataas.com/cat and for https://unsplash.it/1600/900?random.
https://cataas.com/cat has server issues and doesn't always work.
To switch between APIs, you need to uncomment the corresponding lines in the Сubit file.
By default, is getting an image from https://unsplash.it/1600/900?random API.
